        Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region
        and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the United
        States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and
        diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices are
        generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family member
        regardless of breed.

      <h2 class="display-7 fw-bold">Zero to Four Weeks</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is
        either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible.
        Monitor your kittenâ€™s growth closely to make sure its growth rate is
        progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate,
        a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle
        or a feeding tube.

        Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include the
        following:
      </p>
      <ul class="lead">
        <li>too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
        <li>gastrointestinal disease</li>
        <li>
          environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary
          conditions
        </li>
      </ul>

  <h2 class="display-7 fw-bold">Four Weeks to One Year</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around
    three to four weeks after birth. According to the <a
      href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips"
      target="_blank">ASPCA</a
    >, kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six
    to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties
    eating hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food.
    Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients
    that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed,
    your cat may have different dietary requirements. You should always consult
    with your veterinarian for recommendations.
  </p>
  <h2 class="display-7 fw-bold">One Year to Seven Years</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many
    nutrients. At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so does their
    metabolism. It is <b>not</b> recommended to leave food out for the cats all day.
    Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking
    throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related
    feline ailments.
  </p>
  <h2 class="display-7 fw-bold">Seven Years and More</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and
    experience a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat less fats and
    calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing
    packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein
    (such as "salmon") and <b>not</b> just a category (such as fish). This usually
    means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality proteins.
